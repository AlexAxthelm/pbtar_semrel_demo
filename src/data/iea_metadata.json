    "overview": "Going one step beyond the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) shows how that future would be different if all countries were to hit their aspirational targets, including national and regional net zero emissions pledges, on time and in full. This scenario has a 50% probability to not exceed  a global warming of 1.7°C by 2100. The difference between the APS and the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario highlights the ambition gap between countries’ commitments and a 1.5°C pathway.",
    "expertRecommendation": "The APS shows how future would look like if all countries were to hit their aspirational targets, including national and regional net zero emissions pledges, on time and in full. This scenario has a 50% probability to not exceed 1.7°C by 2100. The difference between this scenario and the Net Zero scenario from IEA highlight the ambition gap, still missing in countries commitment\nEmissions forecast in the APS\nThe following Net-Zero emissions targets are integrated: Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore and Viet Nam by 2050, Indonesia by 2060 and Thailand by 2065.\nThe global emissions diminish by 15% between 2023 and 2030, and by 70% between 2023 and 2050. In Southeast Asia, emissions peak is not yet reached, emissions increasing by 7% until 2030. Emissions are set to decrease by 55% between 2023 and 2050 in Southeast Asia.\nRole of policies in APS\nIn its 2024 release, APS includes most recent version of NDC targets with for example, coal phase out commitment. In South East Asia, APS models a coal phase out commitment in 2044 for Malaysia, in 2050 for Thailand, in 2056 for Indonesia and 2050 in Vietnam with JETP support. It can also includes country power development plan, with for example the inclusion of Malaysian National Energy Transition Roadmap, aiming to increase the share of renewables to 40% in 2040 and 70% in 2050. It will also include company business plan, and includes for example Indonesian top utilities Electricity Supply Business Plan and its target of 30GW of additional renewables energy capacity by 2033. \nTo accompany the transition, APS models a carbon price, affecting electricity, industry and energy production sector all over the world. The carbon tax have 3 level of regional granularity based on country economic level and net zero pledges. Indonesia, for example, will have a CO2 tax of 40$/ t of CO2 in 2030, 65 in 2035, 110 in 2040 and 165 in 2050. Other countries in ASEAN will have a CO2 tax of 6$/ t of CO2 in 2035, 17$/ t of CO2 in 2040 and 47$/ t of CO2 in 2050.\nTechnology Costs and Deployment\nTechnology deployment is influenced by technology costs. Solar, Wind and Battery storage benefits decreasing cost trajectory reflecting global learning curves and economies of scale.\nTechnology costs and supply assumptions are defined for biggest market (EU, US, China, India), but data for South East Asia is not provided.\nDemand shifts\nBecause APS relies mostly on NDC, changes between APS and STEPS are mostly due to energy efficiency. Only 1% of emissions reductions are due to behavioral change in 2035, mostly in the transportation sector. For that reason, APS forecast an important electrification effort. Electricity demand increased by 28% globally between 2023 and 2050, and increase by 130% until 2050 from 2023 level. In South East Asia, this increase is even moreimportant with a 42% increase between 2023 and 2030. 2/3 of this added generation should be made of renewables in APS forecast.\nInvestment requirement\nRegarding investment, APS forecast global investment figure. \nEmerging market share of investment in the power sector remains constant at 56%, while this share increase at 58-59% in NZE and STEPS in 2030.\nUnabated fossil fuels represents 1% of total power investment by 2030. Wind and Solar PV represents 45% of total investment.\nInfrastructure dependency\nTransmission and distribution investment increased from 375 billion USD in 2023 to 905 billion USD in 2035, with a total investment share increasing from 30% to 41%.\nRegarding grid constraint, APS provide some global grid replacement and extensions figure.\nTechnology Availability\nDue to the way the scenario is constructed, the availability and deployment of technologies are assumed by policy objectives. The IEA then relies on energy development plans to build roadmaps. Ambition and higher assumptions will rely more on how to attribute expected capital to achieve targets than on technology availability.\nNotes:\n- Other sectors includes: Rare earths mining.\n- Technologies include unabated coal, unabated gas, and fossil fuels w/CCUS. Technologies also includes power from hydrogen",
